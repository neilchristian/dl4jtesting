Map of Michael Brown's final moments
At about midday on 9 August 2014, Officer Darren Wilson was driving a police car on Canfield Drive, St Louis, Missouri, and encountered teenager Michael Brown and a friend. 
The subsequent course of events are disputed between police and other witnesses, but minutes later and about 150ft (50m) further down the road, Mr Brown had been shot dead. 
After three months of deliberation, a Missouri grand jury decided that Mr Wilson would not be charged with any crime. 
This sparked violent protests which led to dozens of arrests in the town of Ferguson and beyond.
