Sandy: New York devastation mapped
Super-storm Sandy has devastated parts of the US east coast, leading President Barack Obama to declare a "major disaster" in New York state. 
New York, the country's most populous city, is among the worst-hit, with floodwaters swamping the subway system, flooding low-lying streets and wiping out power. Explore the map of New York below to see some of the worst of the damage. 
Parts of New York City are designated hurricane evacuation zones - low-lying areas most at risk from flooding. 
The most vulnerable areas are marked in blue on the map below. Most of the flooding from super-storm Sandy appears to be in these locations. 
See a selection of views below of parts of Manhattan and New York before and after the storm.
