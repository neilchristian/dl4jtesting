China tea set and brooch among royals' gifts to Obamas
Among the gifts from the Royal Family and UK PM David Cameron to US President Barack Obama in 2011 were a china tea set, an eagle tapestry and a dog toy, the US state department has revealed. 
Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy gave the Obamas an array of luxury goods valued at $41,676 (£26,910). 
Following US custom, the Obamas and other US public officials seldom keep gifts from foreign leaders. 
They are instead deposited with the US National Archives. 
The gifts were reported in an annual filing by the US state department's protocol office. 
Queen Elizabeth II gave Mr Obama a red leather-bound volume entitled A Selection of Papers From the Royal Archives 1834-1897, signed photos of herself to several senior White House aides, and a brooch with gold leaves and coral flowers to First Lady Michelle Obama. 
Prince Charles gave the Obamas a 15-piece china tea set. 
Mr Cameron gave the family a large tapestry with an eagle and American flag design by the Rug Company, silver bracelets for daughters Sasha and Malia, and a "bone-shaped chew toy with United Kingdom flag", presumably for Bo, the family's four-year-old dog. 
The gifts from the Royal Family and Mr Cameron total about $7,137 (£4,606). 
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave Mr Obama a ball signed by the 2011 Toronto Raptors professional basketball team, as well as a "golden-framed 19th Century antique map of North America, surrounded by drawings of North American Indians, beavers". 
Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy presented the Obama family with an array of gifts on several occasions in 2011, among them a glass sculpture of Bucephalus, Alexander the Great's horse, several Hermes bags, a 200 euro (£168) souvenir coin and a reusable grocery tote.
