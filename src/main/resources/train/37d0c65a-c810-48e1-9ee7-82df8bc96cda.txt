Senate Republicans unveil healthcare bill
Senate Republicans have unveiled a plan to overhaul the US healthcare system, including drastic cuts to a government health programme for the poor. 
The 142-page "discussion draft" repeals most of President Barack Obama's signature health law. 
The Senate plan drops a requirement for individuals to have health insurance and eliminates taxes on the wealthy. 
Republicans, who released the bill after weeks of behind-closed-door talks, need 50 votes to pass it. 
The legislation affects tens of millions of Americans and a fifth of the US economy. 
Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, who crafted most of the plan, presented the Better Care Reconciliation Act Of 2017 to the upper chamber on Thursday. 
The bill mostly aligns with a measure passed by the House of Representatives last month, but ties federal subsidies for individuals based on their income rather than age. 
It would make it more difficult for recipients to qualify for those subsidies, however, by implementing more restrictions on income requirements. 
The Senate bill phases out the expansion of Medicare - much like the House bill - but does so more gradually. 
Details of the draft also include: 
Senator McConnell expects the bill to come to the Senate floor as early as next week, when the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office releases the plan's estimated cost and impact on Americans. 
Repealing Mr Obama's law, called the Affordable Care Act but also known as Obamacare, was a central promise of Republicans throughout his presidency.
