Trump fan charged with hate crimes over JFK Muslim attack
A Massachusetts man has been charged with hate crimes for allegedly kicking a Muslim worker at New York's JFK airport and shouting expletives at her. 
Robin Rhodes, 57, is accused of saying "Trump... will get rid of all of you." and blocking the woman from leaving her office in the Delta Sky Lounge. 
Assault and unlawful imprisonment are among the hate crimes charges he faces, the Queens District Attorney said. 
He faces up to four years in prison if convicted. 
Hate crime 'surge' after Trump win 
The Delta airlines employee, who wears a headscarf or hijab, was sitting in her office on Wednesday evening when Mr Rhodes is alleged to have come up to the door, sworn at her, punched the door, blocked the doorway and kicked her in the right leg. 
When another individual intervened and she then left the office, he is alleged to have followed her and got down on his knees in an imitation of Muslim prayer. 
Mr Rhodes is accused of shouting obscenities about Islam and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group, and saying: "Trump is here now. He will get rid of all of you. You can ask Germany, Belgium and France about these kind of people. You will see what happens."
