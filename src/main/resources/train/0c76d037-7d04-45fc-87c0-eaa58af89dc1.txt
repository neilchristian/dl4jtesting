Canada Liberal leader Trudeau admits marijuana use as MP
The leader of the Canadian Liberal Party has admitted smoking marijuana while a sitting member of parliament. 
Justin Trudeau, 41, who called for the drug's legalisation in June, told the Huffington Post he last smoked marijuana three years ago. 
Elected MP for Papineau, Quebec, in 2008, he is the eldest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. 
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Steven Harper told the website that asthma had prevented him trying the drug. 
Mr Trudeau's disclosure came in a survey by the news website of Canadian party leaders' drug use. 
New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair told the Huffington Post he too had smoked marijuana but declined to say when. 
Mr Trudeau said he last smoked marijuana at a dinner party while his children were staying overnight with their grandmother. 
"One of our friends lit a joint and passed it around," he said. "I had a puff." 
He said he had used marijuana five or six times in his life but had never purchased the drug. He said he does not drink coffee and had never used hard drugs. 
His admission drew swift condemnation from the majority Conservative Party. 
"By flouting the laws of Canada while holding elected office, [Trudeau] shows he is a poor example for all Canadians, particularly young ones," Justice Minister Peter MacKay told broadcaster CBC.
