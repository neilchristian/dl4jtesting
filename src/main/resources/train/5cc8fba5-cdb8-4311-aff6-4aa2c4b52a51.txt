First Lady Melania Trump's official portrait 'heavily airbrushed'
The White House has released the first official portrait of First Lady Melania Trump. 
The 46-year-old former model's photograph was taken at the White House, according to the administration. 
Details on the photographer or when the gauzy portrait was taken were not immediately available. 
"I am honoured to serve in the role of First Lady, and look forward to working on behalf of the American people over the coming years," Mrs Trump said.

Who is the new first family? 
But not everyone was impressed. 
Cosmopolitan Magazine said the photo "appeared to be heavily airbrushed". 
The women's publication - no stranger to Photoshop itself - added: "This soft lighting is like only the classiest '90s mall glamour shot photo could offer!" 
The first lady lives in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, and has largely remained out of the spotlight since her husband took office. 
Mrs Trump and her son are expected to move into the White House after Barron finishes the school year. 
She plans to focus on the problem of cyber-bullying among children, according to her biography on the White House website. 
Mrs Trump, a native of Slovenia, is the second first lady to be born outside of the United States.
